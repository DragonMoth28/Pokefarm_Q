# Pokefarm_Q
This includes any Pokéfarm Q SVGs I need to put offsite, because Sally won't let me host SVG files on the Image Uploader! 

Niet can't help and I refused to ask for help after one person didn't know so now I wrestle Github.

All I need is your OG Plateform SVG and your custom sprite (must have the creator's permission for you to use it, if it's yours, tell me!).
